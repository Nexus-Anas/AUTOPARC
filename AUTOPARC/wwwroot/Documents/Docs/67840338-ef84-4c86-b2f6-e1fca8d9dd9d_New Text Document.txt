2-The time when I felt very successful was when I got a programming certificate from Google, as I devoted my time to studying it. It added a lot of value to me as I gained excellent experience in the field of informatics. And what made me complete it to the end is my love for programming because for me it is my only outlet.

3-The time I felt like a complete failure was when I was in high school, as most of my teachers were blaming me for having difficulty with awareness and concentration. Instead of guiding me and helping me to improve my level, they kept insulting me which made me consider me a failure. But I got over it and outdid myself in many things because I no longer cared about other people's opinions of me.

4-I learned from my success that no matter how hard I try, and no matter how much I excel, I still have a lot to learn. Because life is a school and the older we get the more we learn new things

5-I learned from my failure that it is not too late, no matter how late I am in achieving something, but that delay is in my favor. We have to learn from our mistakes and the first step is to accept the mistake itself
